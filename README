OpenDXL Streaming Java Client Library
=======================================

Overview
--------

The OpenDXL Streaming Java client library is used to consume records
from and produce records to a
`Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_
(DXL) Streaming Service.

The DXL Streaming Service exposes a REST-based API that communicates
with a back-end streaming platform (Kafka, Kinesis, etc.). The streaming service
performs authentication and authorization and exposes methods to retrieve
and produce records.

One concrete example of a DXL Streaming Service is the
`McAfee Investigator <https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/investigator.html>`_
"Events feed".
